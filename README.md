This is a program I am developing. Its goal is for clients to be able to make a connection from to the server and add songs to a Queue and the songs will play on the host machine. I am using a the incredible GMusicProxy API based on the GMuisc API make consistent links to M3U files. Clients will enter songs in on the website and then this information will be fed into the proxy. After the song is looked up, I used the python-vlc bindings to amke my own media player that will play the song.
